    "1. First approach is to drop those rows or columns which have the missing or corrupted. But on one condition, If the missing and currepted data is less or small (i.e. 1-3% percent of entire data), other wise we have some another approach based on statistics for imputing the missing or curepted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Imputation: Impute with mean, median and mode before applying mean, median and mode first we have to analyse the distribution and skewness of data. Mean & Median is applying on numerica data and Node is applying on categorical or string data.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to apply mean, median and mode?\n",
    "* If data is distributed normally awithout any skewness then filled missing values with **mean** .\n",
    "* If data is not norammly distributed and have the skewness in data then **median** approach is applied for imputing missing values.\n",
    "* Mode is applie on string data. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can impute the missing values wit the help ML Regression algorithm by considering the missing value column as a target column and based on other related column predict the target values for filling the missing values. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can apply KNN imputation technique by calculatig the average distance of the nearest neighbour's values. Which neighbour's distance will small then impute by those neighbour's value."

    "\n",
    " * Pre-Processing: In data pre-processing we perform some techniques on data such as data transformation, scaling and splitting data into train and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Model Building: In this stage build a model by using the pre-processed data gsetting best parameters for selected ML algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Third stage is to calculate the performance of the model. If model is based on classification problem then we calculates some key metrics such as precision score, recall score, f1-scoe and accuracy score as well as calculate confusion matrix which tells about the True and False prediction. If selected model is regressior model then we have to calculate MSE (Mean Squared Error) values and R-Squared value to know the accuracy of the model."
